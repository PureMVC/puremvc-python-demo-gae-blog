1.1 - Commented the code and added the following:
	* Edit post functionality, able to edit both post and title
	* Delete post functionality, simply deletes a post based on the 
	  key value in the query string.
      Changed the following:
	* In vo.PostVO changed datetime to use the auto_now=True parameter 
	  instead of auto_now_add=True so that it updates when the post is edited
	* Moved redirect functionality from the view.py Mediators into the 
	  ResponseHandler classes in main.py because the view should not be 
	  handling a state change.
   
      Also, note that the current version of PureMVC Python is included, this 
      is due to the nature of Google Apps that any libraries used must be 
      included in the application folder.
      
1.0 - Initial project, demonstrating the use of PureMVC Python with
      Google App Engine.
